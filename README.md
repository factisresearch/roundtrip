roundtrip allows the definition of bidirectional (de-)serialization
specifications. The specification language is based on the ideas described
in the paper Invertible Syntax Descriptions: Unifying Parsing and Pretty
Printing by Tillmann Rendel and Klaus Ostermann, Haskell Symposium 2010.

This package does not provide concrete instances of the specification
classes, see the packages roundtrip-string and roundtrip-xml instead.

The package contains slightly modified code from Tillmann Rendel's
partial-isomorphisms and invertible-syntax packages (Copyright (c) 2010-11
University of Marburg).
